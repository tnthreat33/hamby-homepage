        <p>I grew up in East Tennessee and attended Lipscomb University as an undergrad. While studying there I fell in love with working in sports. After graduating I worked as a ticket sales representative for the ACC Championships before moving to NYC. In New York, I started graduate school at NYU studying sports business. It was a class during my first year that began my interest in tech and data analytics.</p>
