    <p> I grew up in East Tennessee and attended Lipscomb University as an undergrad. While studying there I fell in love with working in sports. After graduating I worked as a ticket sales representive for the ACC Championships before moving to NYC. In New York I started graduate school at NYU studying sports business. It was a class during my first year that began my interest in tech and data analytics. </p>
